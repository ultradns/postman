# Swagger UI

This directory contains a self-hosted instance of [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui), published via GitHub Pages.

The UI is configured to load the latest OpenAPI specification from the root `spec/` directory of this repository. It serves as a live, interactive reference for the UltraDNS API.

## Live URL

[![Swagger Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger.io/wordpress/images/assets/SW-logo-clr.png)](https://ultradns.github.io/postman/)

## Do Not Modify Directly

This directory is intended to be read-only except for:
- Updating to a newer version of Swagger UI
- Changing the path to the OpenAPI spec
